# Skin Cancer Recognition App

## Overview

Welcome to the Skin Cancer Recognition App! This mobile application is built using React Native and TensorFlow.js to assist users in recognizing skin nevi and providing feedback on whether the detected tumor is benign or malignant.

## Features

- **Camera Integration:** Easily capture images of skin nevi using the device's camera.
  
- **Machine Learning Recognition:** Utilizes TensorFlow.js to analyze captured images and identify patterns associated with benign or malignant tumors.

- **Feedback System:** Provides real-time feedback on the nature of the detected tumor, indicating whether it is likely to be benign or malignant.

## How it Works

1. **Capture Image:** Open the app and use the integrated camera to capture a clear image of the skin nevus.
  
2. **Image Analysis:** TensorFlow.js processes the captured image, extracting relevant features for analysis.

3. **Recognition:** The app's machine learning model evaluates the image, providing feedback on whether the tumor is likely to be benign or malignant.

4. **User Feedback:** Receive instant feedback on the nature of the skin nevus, helping users make informed decisions about seeking medical advice.

## Requirements

- Android or iOS device with a camera
- Internet connection for TensorFlow.js model updates (if applicable)
